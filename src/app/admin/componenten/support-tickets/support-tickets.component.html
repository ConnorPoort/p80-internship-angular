<p>
    need to make a call like this:
    https://(company's-jira).atlassian.net/rest/api/2/search?jql=project=(project name)
    or just this https://(company's-jira).atlassian.net/rest/api/2/search?jql=
    both should be able too get all the open issue's though the 2nd one might also give closed issue's
    and that will return all issue's
    so it would be nice to add a way to change the url to call the right project 
</p>
